## 📜 Firmware Implementation

The control firmware implements a hysteresis-based temperature control algorithm to prevent rapid switching and extend relay lifetime.

### Key Features:
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Continuous DHT22 sensor readings every 3 seconds
- **Hysteresis Control**: 
  - Heater ON when T < 55°C (lower threshold)
  - Heater OFF when T > 70°C (upper threshold)
  - 15°C hysteresis band prevents oscillation
- **Error Handling**: NaN detection and graceful error recovery
- **Serial Monitoring**: Real-time data logging for debugging and analysis

### Control Parameters:
- **Sampling Rate**: 0.33 Hz (3-second intervals)
- **Temperature Range**: 55°C - 70°C (thermophilic composting range)
- **Sensor Accuracy**: ±0.5°C (DHT22 specification)
- **Response Time**: < 3 seconds for temperature changes

# Confirm DHT22 sensor readings via Serial Monitor
```

### 2. Temperature Control Validation
- **Test Condition 1**: Ambient temperature < 55°C
  - **Expected**: Relay activates, heater ON
  - **Verification**: Multimeter continuity test across relay contacts
  
- **Test Condition 2**: Heated temperature > 70°C  
  - **Expected**: Relay deactivates, heater OFF
  - **Verification**: No continuity across relay contacts

### 3. Hysteresis Behavior Test
- **Objective**: Verify 15°C deadband prevents oscillation
- **Method**: Gradually heat/cool system through control thresholds
- **Success Criteria**: No rapid switching within hysteresis band

### 4. Long-term Stability Test
- **Duration**: 24-hour continuous operation
- **Monitoring**: Temperature logs, relay cycle count
- **Metrics**: Temperature stability ±2°C, <100 relay cycles/hour
